This program takes a matrix from the matrix.txt file, changes it into Reduced Row-Echelon Form and then checks for solutions for the system of equations represented by it.

To change the matrix being checked, just put it above the first STOP in the matrix.txt file in the format:
X X X ... X
X X X ... X
...
X X X ... X
There are already a few example matrices in the file, with descriptions, they were used to see if the program works correctly.
